## Push Button Input using Arduino

### Objective
To understand digital input reading and the importance of pull-down resistors.

### Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Push button
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- 10kΩ resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Working
When the button is pressed, the input pin reads HIGH and turns the LED ON. When released, the pull-down resistor forces the pin LOW, turning the LED OFF.

### What I Learned
- Digital input pin behavior
- Floating inputs and why pull-down resistors are needed
- Basic input-output logic
