## LED Blink using Arduino

### Objective
To understand basic digital output control using an Arduino board.

### Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Working
The Arduino toggles a digital pin between HIGH and LOW states with a fixed delay, causing the LED to blink.

### What I Learned
- How digital output pins work
- Why current-limiting resistors are important
- Basic timing using delay()
